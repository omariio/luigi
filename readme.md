This is the Omari site, and a selfnet demo

people.omari.io will have personal APIs in the form of JSONs
aggregators.omari.io will have aggregators in the form of APIs
controllers.omari.io will have interfaces for creating/manipulating data

standard omari.io will have clients

To have the subdomains work locally, you have to add stuff to /etc/hosts.

Mine has these lines

```
127.0.0.1	omari.io
127.0.0.1	people.omari.io
127.0.0.1	aggregators.omari.io
```
